/**
 * Sometimes, you may need to store a value in a variable. But you donâ€™t know its type at the time of writing the program. And the unknown value may come from a third-party API or user input.

In this case, you want to opt out of the type checking and allow the value to pass through the compile-time check.

To do so, you use the any type. The any type allows you to assign a value of any type to a variable:
 */

//json from therd party API
const json = `{"latitude": 10.11, "longitude": 12.12}`;

//perse JSON to find location
const currentLocation = JSON.parse(json);
console.log(currentLocation);
console.log(typeof currentLocation);
